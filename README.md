# InstagramUnfollow
This is a basic python script that gives you a list of the people you follow and don't follow you back on Instagram

To use it, just download your information from instagram (meta account center) and download only followers and followed information in a .json file

after a few minutes you will have some files, pick the followers and following files and copy them into the same folder this program is on 

after that just hit run (the program may stutter if the list is very large, give it a moment to work), after that you will have the list
